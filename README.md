# Netflix Movies and TV Shows Clustering  Unsupervised ML
## PROBLEM STATEMENT OF THE PROJECT 
The business context of this project revolves around exploring a dataset containing TV shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset was collected from Flixable, a third-party Netflix search engine. The aim of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis and derive insights from the dataset, considering factors such as the type of content available in different countries, Netflix's focus on TV shows versus movies in recent years, and clustering similar content based on text-based features. Integrating external datasets like IMDB ratings and Rotten Tomatoes can further enhance the analysis and provide valuable findings.

The dataset provides an opportunity to delve into the content landscape of Netflix and gain insights into the trends and patterns that have emerged over time. By conducting exploratory data analysis, we can uncover various aspects of the dataset and understand the characteristics of the available TV shows and movies. This analysis can involve examining the distribution of content across different genres, exploring the duration of TV shows and movies, and identifying popular categories based on user ratings and reviews.

One key aspect to investigate is the variation in content availability across different countries. By analyzing the dataset, we can determine the types of content that are more prevalent in certain countries and identify any regional preferences. This information can be valuable for content creators and distributors to understand the demand for specific genres or themes in different markets, thereby enabling them to tailor their offerings accordingly and optimize viewership.

Another important question to address is whether Netflix has shifted its focus more towards TV shows in recent years, as indicated by the report that the number of TV shows has significantly increased compared to movies. By examining the temporal distribution of TV shows and movies in the dataset, we can determine if there has been a noticeable shift in Netflix's content strategy. This analysis can shed light on Netflix's evolving approach and help understand the underlying factors driving the change, such as user preferences, market dynamics, or industry trends.

Furthermore, the dataset offers an opportunity to cluster similar content based on text-based features. By employing clustering techniques, such as K-means clustering, we can group TV shows and movies with similar textual characteristics, such as titles, descriptions, or keywords. This clustering analysis can help identify content clusters with shared themes, genres, or narratives. Such insights can assist in content recommendation systems, content categorization, and content acquisition decisions. Additionally, integrating external datasets like IMDB ratings or Rotten Tomatoes scores can further enhance the clustering analysis and provide a comprehensive understanding of content quality and popularity.

In conclusion, this project aims to leverage the Netflix dataset to perform exploratory data analysis, understand content availability across different countries, examine Netflix's focus on TV shows versus movies, and cluster similar content based on text-based features. The insights gained from this analysis can inform strategic decisions related to content creation, distribution, and user engagement, enabling Netflix and other stakeholders to optimize their offerings and enhance the viewer experience. Integrating external datasets can provide additional context and enrich the analysis, leading to more robust findings and actionable recommendations.
